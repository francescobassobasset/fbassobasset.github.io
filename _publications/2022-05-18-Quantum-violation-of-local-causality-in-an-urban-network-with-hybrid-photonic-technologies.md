# Abstract

Quantum networks play a crucial role in distributed quantum information processing, enabling the establishment of entanglement and quantum communication among distant nodes. Fundamentally, networks with independent sources allow for new forms of nonlocality, beyond the paradigmatic Bell’s theorem. Here we implement the simplest of such networks—the bilocality scenario—in an urban network connecting different buildings with a fully scalable and hybrid approach. Two independent sources using different technologies—a quantum dot and a nonlinear crystal—are used to share a photonic entangled state among three nodes connected through a 270 m free-space channel and fiber links. By violating a suitable nonlinear Bell inequality, we demonstrate the nonlocal behavior of the correlations among the nodes of the network. Our results pave the way towards the realization of more complex networks and the implementation of quantum communication protocols in an urban environment, leveraging the capabilities of hybrid photonic technologies.
