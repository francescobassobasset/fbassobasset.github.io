# Abstract

The control over the spectral broadening of an ensemble of emitters, mainly attributable to the size and shape dispersion and the homogenous broadening mechanisms, is crucial to several applications of quantum dots. We present a convenient self-assembly approach to deliver strain-free GaAs quantum dots with size dispersion below 10%, due to the control of the growth parameters during the preliminary formation of the Ga droplets. This results in an ensemble photoluminescence linewidth of 19 meV at 14 K. The narrow emission band and the absence of a wetting layer promoting dot-dot coupling allow us to deconvolve the contribution of phonon broadening in the ensemble photoluminescence and study it in a wide temperature range.
