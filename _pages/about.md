Hello world!

I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Physics from the University of Milan in 2014 and the Ph.D. degree in Materials Science and Nanotechnology in 2018 from the University of Milano-Bicocca. During my PhD, I worked in the Laboratory of Semiconductor Spectroscopy in active collaboration with the interuniversity center L-NESS and the Johannes Kepler University in Linz (8-month research period abroad). My research interests include optical spectroscopy, semiconductor nanotechnology, and quantum optics. I currently focus on designing and performing experiments in quantum information to further develop semiconductor nanostructures as on-demand quantum emitters.
