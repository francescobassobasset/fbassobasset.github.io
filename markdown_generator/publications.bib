  title = {Quantum dot technology for quantum repeaters: from entangled photon generation toward the integration with quantum memories},
  journal = {Materials for Quantum Technology},
  abstract = {The realization of a functional quantum repeater is one of the major research goals in long-distance quantum communication. Among the different approaches that are being followed, the one relying on quantum memories interfaced with deterministic quantum emitters is considered as one of the most promising solutions. In this work, we focus on the hardware to implement memory-based quantum-repeater schemes that rely on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) for the generation of polarization entangled photons. Going through the most relevant figures of merit related to efficiency of the photon source, we select significant developments in fabrication, processing and tuning techniques aimed at combining high degree of entanglement with on-demand pair generation, with a special focus on the progress achieved in the representative case of the GaAs system. We proceed to offer a perspective on integration with quantum memories, both highlighting preliminary works on natural-artificial atomic interfaces and commenting a wide choice of currently available and potentially viable memory solutions in terms of wavelength, bandwidth and noise-requirements. To complete the overview, we also present recent implementations of entanglement-based quantum communication protocols with QDs and highlight the next challenges ahead for the implementation of practical quantum networks.}

  abstract = {Quantum networks play a crucial role for distributed quantum information processing, enabling the establishment of entanglement and quantum communication among distant nodes. Fundamentally, networks with independent sources allow for new forms of nonlocality, beyond the paradigmatic Bell's theorem. Here we implement the simplest of such networks -- the bilocality scenario -- in an urban network connecting different buildings with a fully scalable and hybrid approach. Two independent sources using different technologies, respectively a quantum dot and a nonlinear crystal, are used to share photonic entangled state among three nodes connected through a 270 m free-space channel and fiber links. By violating a suitable non-linear Bell inequality, we demonstrate the nonlocal behaviour of the correlations among the nodes of the network. Our results pave the way towards the realization of more complex networks and the implementation of quantum communication protocols in an urban environment, leveraging on the capabilities of hybrid photonic technologies.}

  title = {Quantum dots as potential sources of strongly entangled photons: Perspectives and challenges for applications in quantum networks},
  journal = {Applied Physics Letters},
  abstract = {The generation and long-haul transmission of highly entangled photon pairs is a cornerstone of emerging photonic quantum technologies with key applications such as quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. However, a natural limit for the maximum transmission distance is inevitably set by attenuation in the medium. A network of quantum repeaters containing multiple sources of entangled photons would allow overcoming this limit. For this purpose, the requirements on the source's brightness and the photon pairs' degree of entanglement and indistinguishability are stringent. Despite the impressive progress made so far, a definitive scalable photon source fulfilling such requirements is still being sought after. Semiconductor quantum dots excel in this context as sub-Poissonian sources of polarization entangled photon pairs. In this work, we present the state-of-the-art set by GaAs based quantum dots and use them as a benchmark to discuss the challenges toward the realization of practical quantum networks.}

  abstract = {We present the design for a novel type of dual-band photodetector in the thermal infrared spectral range, the Optically Controlled Dual-band quantum dot Infrared Photodetector (OCDIP). This concept is based on a quantum dot ensemble with a unimodal size distribution, whose absorption spectrum can be controlled by optically-injected carriers. An external pumping laser varies the electron density in the QDs, permitting to control the available electronic transitions and thus the absorption spectrum. We grew a test sample which we studied by AFM and photoluminescence. Based on the experimental data, we simulated the infrared absorption spectrum of the sample, which showed two absorption bands at 5.85 um and 8.98 um depending on the excitation power. }

  journal = {Applied Physics Letters},
  abstract = {GaAs quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as state-of-the-art semiconductor sources of polarization-entangled photon pairs, however, without site-control capability. In this work, we present a systematic study of epitaxially grown $GaAs/Al_{x}Ga_{1-x}$As site-controlled pyramidal QDs possessing unrivaled excitonic uniformity in comparison to their InGaAs counterparts or GaAs QDs fabricated by other techniques. We have experimentally and systematically investigated the binding energy of biexcitons, highlighting the importance of the uniformity of all excitonic lines, rather than concentrating solely on the uniformity of the neutral exciton as a typical figure of merit, as it is normally done in the literature. We present optical signatures of GaAs QDs within a range of 250 meV with a remarkable uniformity within each individual sample, the ability to excite the biexciton state resonantly, and a systematic study of the fine-structure splitting (FSS) values-features important for polarization entangled photon emission. While, in general, we observe relatively large FSS distribution and associated non-uniformities, we discuss several strategies to suppress the average FSS values to <15 $\mu$eV.}

  title = {Quantum key distribution with entangled photons generated on demand by a quantum dot},
  journal = {Science Advances},
  abstract = {Quantum key distribution-exchanging a random secret key relying on a quantum mechanical resource-is the core feature of secure quantum networks. Entanglement-based protocols offer additional layers of security and scale favorably with quantum repeaters, but the stringent requirements set on the photon source have made their use situational so far. Semiconductor-based quantum emitters are a promising solution in this scenario, ensuring on-demand generation of near-unity-fidelity entangled photons with record-low multiphoton emission, the latter feature countering some of the best eavesdropping attacks. Here, we use a coherently driven quantum dot to experimentally demonstrate a modified Ekert quantum key distribution protocol with two quantum channel approaches: both a 250-m-long single-mode fiber and in free space, connecting two buildings within the campus of Sapienza University in Rome. Our field study highlights that quantum-dot entangled photon sources are ready to go beyond laboratory experiments, thus opening the way to real-life quantum communication.}

  title = {Quantum teleportation with imperfect quantum dots},
  journal = {npj Quantum Information},
  abstract = {Efficient all-photonic quantum teleportation requires fast and deterministic sources of highly indistinguishable and entangled photons. Solid-state-based quantum emitters---notably semiconductor quantum dots---are a promising candidate for the role. However, despite the remarkable progress in nanofabrication, proof-of-concept demonstrations of quantum teleportation have highlighted that imperfections of the emitter still place a major roadblock in the way of applications. Here, rather than focusing on source optimization strategies, we deal with imperfections and study different teleportation protocols with the goal of identifying the one with maximal teleportation fidelity. Using a quantum dot with sub-par values of entanglement and photon indistinguishability, we show that the average teleportation fidelity can be raised from below the classical limit to 0.842(14), adopting a polarization-selective Bell state measurement and moderate spectral filtering. Our results, which are backed by a theoretical model that quantitatively explains the experimental findings, loosen the very stringent requirements set on the ideal entangled-photon source and highlight that imperfect quantum dots can still have a say in teleportation-based quantum communication architectures.}

  journal = {{IEEE} Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics},
  abstract = {Semiconductor quantum dots are currently emerging as one of the most promising sources of non-classical light on which to base future quantum networks. They can generate single photons as well as pairs of entangled photons with unprecedented brightness, indistinguishability, and degree of entanglement. These features have very recently opened up the possibility to perform advanced quantum optics protocols that were previously inaccessible to single quantum emitters. In this work, we report on two experiments that use the non-local properties of entanglement to teleport quantum states: three-photon state teleportation and four-photon entanglement teleportation. We discuss all the experimental results in light of a theoretical model that we develop to account for the non-idealities of the quantum source. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables a deep understanding of how each parameter of the source affects the teleportation fidelities and it pinpoints the requirements needed to overcome the classical limits. Finally, our model suggests how to further improve quantum-dot entangled-photon sources for practical quantum networks.}

The use of high temperatures for the self-assembly of droplet epitaxy quantum dots solves major issues related to material defects, introduced during the droplet epitaxy fabrication process, which limited its use for single and entangled photon sources for quantum photonics applications. We identify the region in the parameter space which allows quantum dots to self-assemble with the desired emission wavelength and highly symmetric shape while maintaining a high optical quality. The role of the growth parameters during the droplet arsenization is discussed and modeled.}

  title = {Entanglement swapping with photons generated on demand by a quantum dot},
  journal = {Physical Review Letters},
  abstract = {Photonic entanglement swapping, the procedure of entangling photons without any direct interaction, is a fundamental test of quantum mechanics and an essential resource to the realization of quantum networks. Probabilistic sources of nonclassical light were used for seminal demonstration of entanglement swapping, but applications in quantum technologies demand push-button operation requiring single quantum emitters. This, however, turned out to be an extraordinary challenge due to the stringent prerequisites on the efficiency and purity of the generation of entangled states. Here we show a proof-of-concept demonstration of all-photonic entanglement swapping with pairs of polarization-entangled photons generated on demand by a GaAs quantum dot without spectral and temporal filtering. Moreover, we develop a theoretical model that quantitatively reproduces the experimental data and provides insights on the critical figures of merit for the performance of the swapping operation. Our theoretical analysis also indicates how to improve state-of-the-art entangled-photon sources to meet the requirements needed for implementation of quantum dots in long-distance quantum communication protocols.}

  abstract = {The control over the spectral broadening of an ensemble of emitters, mainly attributable to the size and shape dispersion and the homogenous broadening mechanisms, is crucial to several applications of quantum dots. We present a convenient self-assembly approach to deliver strain-free GaAs quantum dots with size dispersion below 10%, due to the control of the growth parameters during the preliminary formation of the Ga droplets. This results in an ensemble photoluminescence linewidth of 19 meV at 14 K. The narrow emission band and the absence of a wetting layer promoting dot-dot coupling allow us to deconvolve the contribution of phonon broadening in the ensemble photoluminescence and study it in a wide temperature range.}

The tuning of the relative positioning of QDMs and metal nanoparticles is obtained through the careful control of Ga droplet nucleation sites via Ga surface diffusion. The electronic structure of a typical QDM was evaluated on the base of the morphological characterizations performed by atomic force microscopy and cross sectional scanning electron microscopy, and the predicted results confirmed by micro-photoluminescence experiments, showing that the Ga metal nanoparticle-GaAs quantum molecule complexes are suitable for terahertz generation from intraband transition.}

  journal = {Nano Letters},
  abstract = {Several semiconductor quantum dot techniques have been investigated for the generation of entangled photon pairs. Among the other techniques, droplet epitaxy enables the control of the shape, size, density, and emission wavelength of the quantum emitters. However, the fraction of the entanglement-ready quantum dots that can be fabricated with this method is still limited to around 5%, and matching the energy of the entangled photons to atomic transitions (a promising route toward quantum networking) remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we overcome these obstacles by introducing a modified approach to droplet epitaxy on a high symmetry (111)A substrate, where the fundamental crystallization step is performed at a significantly higher temperature as compared with previous reports. Our method drastically improves the yield of entanglement-ready photon sources near the emission wavelength of interest, which can be as high as 95% due to the low values of fine structure splitting and radiative lifetime, together with the reduced exciton dephasing offered by the choice of GaAs/AlGaAs materials. The quantum dots are designed to emit in the operating spectral region of Rb-based slow-light media, providing a viable technology for quantum repeater stations.}

  abstract = {In this paper we present the exceptional thermal strain release provided by micrometric Si pillar arrays to Ge epitaxial patches suspended on them, for different pillar aspect ratios and patch sizes. By combining 3D and 2D Finite Element Method simulations, low-energy plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition on patterned Si substrates, $\mu$-Raman, $\mu$-photoluminescence and XRD measurements, we provide a quantitative and consistent picture of this effect with the patch sizes. Strain relaxation up to 85% of the value for the corresponding planar films can be obtained for a squared patch 100 $\mu$m in size. Finally, the enhanced thermal strain relaxation is analytically explained in terms of the Si pillar lateral tilting, critically dependent on the pillar aspect ratio, very similarly to the well-known case of a deflected beam. Our results are transferable to any material deposited, or wafer bonded at high temperature, on any patterned substrate: wafer bowing can be controlled by micrometric patterned features well within the present capabilities of deep reactive ion etching.}

  journal = {Nanotechnology},
  abstract = {Large-scale integration of MoS$_2$ in electronic devices requires the development of reliable and cost-effective deposition processes, leading to uniform MoS$_2$ layers on a wafer scale. Here we report on the detailed study of the heterogeneous vapor-solid reaction between a pre-deposited molybdenum solid film and sulfur vapor, thus resulting in a controlled growth of MoS$_2$ films onto SiO$_2$/Si substrates with a tunable thickness and cm$^2$-scale uniformity. Based on Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence, we show that the degree of crystallinity in the MoS$_2$ layers is dictated by the deposition temperature and thickness. In particular, the MoS$_2$ structural disorder observed at low temperature (<750 $^{\circ}$C) and low thickness (two layers) evolves to a more ordered crystalline structure at high temperature (1000 $^{\circ}$C) and high thickness (four layers). From an atomic force microscopy investigation prior to and after sulfurization, this parametrical dependence is associated with the inherent granularity of the MoS$_2$ nanosheet that is inherited by the pristine morphology of the pre-deposited Mo film. This work paves the way to a closer control of the synthesis of wafer-scale and atomically thin MoS$_2$, potentially extendable to other transition metal dichalcogenides and hence targeting massive and high-volume production for electronic device manufacturing.}
