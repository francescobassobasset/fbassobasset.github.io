I am an experimental physicist passionate about solid state and quantum physics. My research interests include optical spectroscopy, semiconductor nanotechnology, and quantum optics. I am currently a Researcher (RTDa) at the [Physics Department](https://www.phys.uniroma1.it/fisica/en) of the Sapienza University of Rome. I have been working since 2018 in the [Nanophotonics group](https://trotta-nanophotonics.weebly.com/) lead by Prof. Rinaldo Trotta on research projects funded first by the ERC Starting Grant SPQRel and then by the FET Open Qurope.

## My research

My current research activities mainly focus on the study, optimization, and application of quantum dots as single and entangled photon sources. Using this technology, I have successfully worked on the implementation of ubiquitous quantum communication protocols, such as quantum teleportation, entanglement swapping, and quantum key distribution. I believe that combining key advances in materials and quantum information science offers great prospects: one of the goals of my research is to show that the introduction of novel photon sources in combination with steady experimental development leads to original contributions to the field of quantum optics.

## My background

Before moving to Rome, I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Physics from the University of Milan in 2014 and the Ph.D. degree in Materials Science and Nanotechnology in 2018 from the University of Milano-Bicocca. During my Ph.D., I worked in the Laboratory of Semiconductor Spectroscopy in active collaboration with the interuniversity center L-NESS in Como and the Johannes Kepler University in Linz (8-month research period abroad). Throughout the years, I had the opportunity to collaborate with partners from many institutions across Europe:  Johannes Kepler University Linz (Prof. Armando Rastelli), University of Paderborn (Prof. Klaus D. JÃ¶ns), KTH Stockholm (Prof. Val Zwiller), Tyndall National Institute Cork (Prof. Emanuele Pelucchi), University of Milano-Bicocca (Prof. Stefano Sanguinetti), Sapienza University of Rome (Prof. Fabio Sciarrino).
