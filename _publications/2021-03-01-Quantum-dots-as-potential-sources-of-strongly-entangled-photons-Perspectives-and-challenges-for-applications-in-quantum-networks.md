# Abstract

The generation and long-haul transmission of highly entangled photon pairs is a cornerstone of emerging photonic quantum technologies with key applications such as quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. However, a natural limit for the maximum transmission distance is inevitably set by attenuation in the medium. A network of quantum repeaters containing multiple sources of entangled photons would allow overcoming this limit. For this purpose, the requirements on the source's brightness and the photon pairs' degree of entanglement and indistinguishability are stringent. Despite the impressive progress made so far, a definitive scalable photon source fulfilling such requirements is still being sought after. Semiconductor quantum dots excel in this context as sub-Poissonian sources of polarization entangled photon pairs. In this work, we present the state-of-the-art set by GaAs based quantum dots and use them as a benchmark to discuss the challenges toward the realization of practical quantum networks.
