# Abstract

We present the design for a novel type of dual-band photodetector in the thermal infrared spectral range, the Optically Controlled Dual-band quantum dot Infrared Photodetector (OCDIP). This concept is based on a quantum dot ensemble with a unimodal size distribution, whose absorption spectrum can be controlled by optically injected carriers. An external pumping laser varies the electron density in the QDs, permitting to control the available electronic transitions and thus the absorption spectrum. We grew a test sample which we studied by AFM and photoluminescence. Based on the experimental data, we simulated the infrared absorption spectrum of the sample, which showed two absorption bands at 5.85 μm and 8.98 μm depending on the excitation power.
