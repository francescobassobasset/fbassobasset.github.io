# Abstract

Semiconductor quantum dots are currently emerging as one of the most promising sources of non-classical light on which to base future quantum networks. They can generate single photons as well as pairs of entangled photons with unprecedented brightness, indistinguishability, and degree of entanglement. These features have very recently opened up the possibility to perform advanced quantum optics protocols that were previously inaccessible to single quantum emitters. In this work, we report on two experiments that use the non-local properties of entanglement to teleport quantum states: three-photon state teleportation and four-photon entanglement teleportation. We discuss all the experimental results in light of a theoretical model that we develop to account for the non-idealities of the quantum source. The excellent agreement between theory and experiment enables a deep understanding of how each parameter of the source affects the teleportation fidelities and it pinpoints the requirements needed to overcome the classical limits. Finally, our model suggests how to further improve quantum-dot entangled-photon sources for practical quantum networks.
