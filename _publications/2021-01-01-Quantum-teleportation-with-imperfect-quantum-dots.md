# Abstract

Efficient all-photonic quantum teleportation requires fast and deterministic sources of highly indistinguishable and entangled photons. Solid-state-based quantum emitters---notably semiconductor quantum dots---are a promising candidate for the role. However, despite the remarkable progress in nanofabrication, proof-of-concept demonstrations of quantum teleportation have highlighted that imperfections of the emitter still place a major roadblock in the way of applications. Here, rather than focusing on source optimization strategies, we deal with imperfections and study different teleportation protocols with the goal of identifying the one with maximal teleportation fidelity. Using a quantum dot with sub-par values of entanglement and photon indistinguishability, we show that the average teleportation fidelity can be raised from below the classical limit to 0.842(14), adopting a polarization-selective Bell state measurement and moderate spectral filtering. Our results, which are backed by a theoretical model that quantitatively explains the experimental findings, loosen the very stringent requirements set on the ideal entangled-photon source and highlight that imperfect quantum dots can still have a say in teleportation-based quantum communication architectures.
