# Abstract

During recent years, quantum dots have become an increasingly established source of highly entangled photons. The main motivation for the development of this technology has resided in the expectation that a resonantly driven quantum emitter can offer a path towards on-demand photon pair generation. In fact, state-of-the-art sources relying on spontaneous parametric down-conversion intrinsically suffer from multipair emission at high pair generation rates, which causes a tradeoff between brightness and degree of entanglement. Despite the key importance of this aspect, the experimental study of how multiphoton emission affects the entanglement properties of quantum dot-based sources has received surprisingly little attention. In this paper we report the investigation of the multipair emission of the source under quasi-deterministic resonant two-photon excitation without filtering the excitation laser using polarization suppression. The focus is on measuring the real multipair emission entering in entanglement-based measurements, minimizing measurement artefacts from the setup and in particular from the excitation source. This is investigated by measuring the second-order correlation function at zero-time delay in several measurement conditions, including spectral filtering. Our work confirms that the multipair emission is provided also for entanglement-based measurement conditions and thus helps the design of efficient photon sources for quantum information and communication technologies.
