# Abstract

The realization of a functional quantum repeater is one of the major research goals in long-distance quantum communication. Among the different approaches that are being followed, the one relying on quantum memories interfaced with deterministic quantum emitters is considered as one of the most promising solutions. In this work, we focus on the hardware to implement memory-based quantum-repeater schemes that rely on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) for the generation of polarization entangled photons. Going through the most relevant figures of merit related to efficiency of the photon source, we select significant developments in fabrication, processing and tuning techniques aimed at combining high degree of entanglement with on-demand pair generation, with a special focus on the progress achieved in the representative case of the GaAs system. We proceed to offer a perspective on integration with quantum memories, both highlighting preliminary works on natural-artificial atomic interfaces and commenting a wide choice of currently available and potentially viable memory solutions in terms of wavelength, bandwidth and noise-requirements. To complete the overview, we also present recent implementations of entanglement-based quantum communication protocols with QDs and highlight the next challenges ahead for the implementation of practical quantum networks.
